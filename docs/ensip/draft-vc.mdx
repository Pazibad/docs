# ENSIP-XX: Verifiable Credentials & Presentations

### Abstract

This ENSIP aims to standardize the usage of [W3C Verifiable Credentials & Presentations](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) within ENS records.

### Motivation

With the increasing prevalence of self-custodial digital identity & attestation solutions, it is of importance to have a standardized way to publicly share verifiable credentials using your ENS profile.

### Specification

#### Very Rough Draft

did/url links to vc
vc contains **metadata** **claims** & **proof**
implementations choose what "proof"s they support (aka, what credentials they accept/trust)
claims are the actual data thats being attested

#### Verifications in Profiles

Defines the use of the `verifications` record.
This record aims to store a list of verifiable credentials or did's, pointing towards certain credentials

#### Example

An example of a verifiable credential

```json
// this example is wip
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://example.com/credentials/3847",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
  "issuanceDate": "2024-05-21T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "knows": "did:example:6f1c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc"
  }
}
```

or in the form of a presentation:

```json
// this example is wip
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
  "verfiableCredential": [
    {
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
      ],
      "id": "https://credentials.dentity.com/credentials/1234",
      "type": [
        "VerifiableCredential",
        "ProofOfTwitterCredential"
      ],
      "issuer": {
        "id": "did:example:dentity"
      },
      "issuanceDate": "2000-00-00T00:00:00Z",
      "twitter": "lucemansnl",
      ...
      "proof": {
          ...
      }
   }
  ],
  "id": "12345",
  "holder": "did:ens:luc.eth",
  "proof": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Considerations

#### Revocation & Expiration

Verifiable Credentials are meant to be used as long-lived documents.
However this does not mean that they can't be revoked or expired.
In a similar manner to physical documents, a credentials validity can be checked by contacting the issuer (Think of how a store might only look at your drivers license, while a car dealership would run it through a computer).

The implementation of verification is specific to each issuer, and can be inferred from `verificationMethod` in the credential.
In addition to the `expirationDate` field, which causes the credential to invalidate after a certain date.

This means that identity platforms can allow users to revoke (or expand) credentials without needing to modify the records in ENS.

### Backwards Compatibility

This ENSIP relies on the existing ENS text record functionality introduced in [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5), and only standardizes the usage of the specific `verifications` record.

### Security Considerations

None.
